    Implemented flag ``network_overrides_only`` which is applicable to
    ``systemd_networks``. When this flag is used no .network or .link
    defenition is created - only ``{{ filename }}.network.d/overrides.conf``
    configuration file, which contains arbitrary data from ``config_overrides``
    This can be used to extend existing interface configuration, which is not
    managed by the role directly (ie managed through ``netplan``).

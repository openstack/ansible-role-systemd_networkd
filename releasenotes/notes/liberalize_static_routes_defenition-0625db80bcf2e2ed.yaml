features:

    Keys for ``static_routes`` were liberalized and now can accept any
    parameter supported by ``[Route]`` section of systemd-networkd.
upgrade:
  - |
    Following keys for ``static_routes`` list were renamed in order to
    match with options available in systemd-networkd configuration files:

    - ``cidr`` -> ``Destination``
    - ``gateway`` -> ``Gateway``

    While backwards compatability was kept, it's highly recommended to
    use new keys as support for old key names will be removed in the future.

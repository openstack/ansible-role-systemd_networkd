# The systemd networkd dictionary is a set of networks that will be created.
# items generated will have an integer assigned to them so that they're loaded
# in the order specified. The dictionary can contain the following options:
#  `config_overrides` -- (optional) used to inject extra configuration options
#                                   into the network file. A full list of all
#                                   options can be found here:
#                                   https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html
#  `interface` -- (required) Name of interface to match
#  `address` -- (option) IP address the interface should be given. To make this
#                        interface use DHCP set this string to "dhcp"
#  `netmask` -- (optional) Netmask to use for the interface
#  `gateway` -- (optional) Gateway to use for the interface
#  `bridge` -- (optional) Bridge name for a mapped interface
#  `bond` -- (optional) Bond name for a mapped interface
#  `vlan` -- (optional) VLAN name for a mapped interface
#  `macvlan` -- (optional) MACVLAN name for a mapped interface
#  `vxlan` -- (optional) VXLAN name for a mapped interface
#  `mtu` -- (optional) MTU to use for the interface

#                         running in dhcp mode
#  `static_routes` -- (optional) list of routes to use for the network. This
#                                option requires a gateway and cidr to be set
